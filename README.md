# List of functions
`fStokesIn.m`
Function to prepare the input. This will output a MATLAB containing all the necessary inputs. Read the comments inside the function for details.

`fDispersionV5.m`
The dispersion equation linking the wave period and wave length, with variable orders (in terms of the wave steepness, Hk/2) from 1-5. If the order is not given, it defaults to 1st-order when H is not given; and defaults to 5th-order when H is given.

`fStokesEta.m`
Computes the free water surface elevation.

`fStokesVel.m`
Computes the underlying water particle velocities.

`fStokesAcc.m`
Computes the underlying water particle accelerations.

`fStokesFit.m`
An interactive tool to fit a stokes wave to an exisiting wave profile.
